# Z-Site

**[My personal website](https://ironbatman2715.github.io/) for displaying my works or linking to other relevant sites.**

- A static site generator (SSG) built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Automatic build and deploy to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Fully functional with *or* without JavaScript enabled in the client's browser

Original versions of optimized assets as well as currently unused assets are stored in [`assetArchive`](./assetArchive/).
